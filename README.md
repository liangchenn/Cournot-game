# Cournot-game
A Cournot game solver.  
  
  
Taking in each firm's marginal cost, capacity, and a ownership matrix (default to nxn identity matrix) as input,  
  
and yields the producing level of each production unit.  
  
This solver also allows firms to have sub-unit (i.e. firms will take each sub-unit's   
  
profit into its optimization problem), which is controlled by the ownership matrix.
